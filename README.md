Package provides functions that use the features of the PyLaTeX package (see https://jeltef.github.io/PyLaTeX/current/index.html or https://github.com/JelteF/PyLaTeX). All LaTeX features are credited to the original package, this package only makes use of them to make my own workflow more efficient when using the PyLaTeX package.
